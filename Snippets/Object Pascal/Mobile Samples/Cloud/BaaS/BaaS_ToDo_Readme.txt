BaaS ToDo List Demo Application Readme 

The ToDo List BaaS demo allows you to post and get data from your data collection using Kinvey as your 
Backend As a Service Provider. This demo requires that you sign up for an account on Kinvey.com.
Once you have signed up for an account, you will need to enter the App Key, App Secret and Master Key 
on the KinveyProvider component on the Data Module. 

While this demo uses Kinvey as the Backend As a Service Provider, you can also use the Parse Provider 
component instead by deleting the Kinvey provider component and connecting it to the Backend Storage component.

Once you have signed up for a Kinvey account, and have the application deployed to your device, you will 
be able to see your data by logging into your account on Kinvey.com, and going to Add-Ons->Data & Storage ->Data Store.
